# NoFences

Didn't want to pay $16US, Cloned someone elses project.  Might completely fork to become my own dont know yet.  Warning this has serious bugs,  you can not delete a reference out of the dock/fence you cant drag it out and if you delete it it deletes the file completely.   it also leaves things on the desktop as well as in the fence.  It's really early alpha.  The person that wrote it basically abandonded it as it has not been touched in years on the OG.
